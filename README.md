5. Navigate into the repo you cloned.

         cd Basit-Git-Command
6. Create an empty file named `index.html` and add this content
   to the file "This is the Admin creating an index.html file for Tom and Jerry.
"

7. Check changes has not been staged.

         
       git status
   ![](./img/g8.png) 

8. Stage changes

       git add index.html
    ![](./img/g9.png) 

9. Confirm changes have been staged for commit.

         
       git status
   ![](./img/g10.png)

10. Commit changes

         git commit -m 'Header changes to index file'

    git commit takes the staged changes and records them in the 
   repositories history with a message on what was done.

11. Push main branch to Git Hub

          git push


SIMULATING TOM and JERRY'S WORK.

We would simulate tom and jerrys work by creating TWO(2) since we 
are working with same laptop.You will switch between the branches making
changes as each character.

TOMS WORK.

1.Navigate to the project repository

      cd Basic-Git-Command
![](./img/g11.png)

This moves Tom to a folder containing the cloned repository on your
local machine.Its like stepping into the projects workspace.

2 Check the current branch by command `git branch`.This shows you the list of 
all branches in your local repository.
INITIALLY,only the main branch exist,because thats the default starting point and no other
branch has been created.

      git branch
![](./img/g12.png)

3 Create a BRANCH for TOMS work.

      git checkout -b update-navigation

![](./img/g13.png)
This creates a new branch named `update-navigation` and switches it
automatically to the new branch from the `main` branch.This branch
`update-navigation` is where we simulate TOMS contribution to the Website
without affecting whatever is in the main branch.

4 Check the list of branch again.

      git branch
   ![](./img/g14.png)

Running `git branch` again now shows your newly created branch,indicating
you are now working in this new `workspace`dedicated to TOMS updates.All files
from the main also exist in TOMS new workspace.

5 TOMS Adds content to the index.html file

      This is Tom adding Navigation to the AI-website
   
   ![](./img/g15.png)

6.Check the status

      git status

 ![](./img/g16.png)

 At this stage TOM has modified the file,but these changes haven't
 been prepared for a commit in git.This is indicated by the file appearing in red indicating 
 the changes are recognized by git but not yet staged.

 7 Stage TOMS changes

      git add index.html

   This tells Git that TOM wants to include the updates made to `index.html`
   in the next commit.

 8 Confirm changes have been staged for commit.

      git status
 ![](./img/g17.png)
   
9 Commit changes.

      git commit -m "Update navigation bar"
This takes the staged changes and record them in the repostory history
with a message describing what was done.

10 Push TOMS work to GITHUB

      git push origin update-navigation
